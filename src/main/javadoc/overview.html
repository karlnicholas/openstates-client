<p>This program is a RESTful Client API for the <a href="http://openstates.org">OpenStates.org Website.</a></p>

<p>The <a href="http://sunlightlabs.github.io/openstates-api/">OpenStates API</a> site has 
additional information and terms of use.</p>

<p>The user will typically use the classes in the org.openstates.classes package.</p>

<p>Java version 1.6 at a minimum is required. The json client library org.fasterxml.jackson-databind.jar, version 2.2.3 was used 
and is required. An earlier or later version may be used but hasn't been tested.</p>

<p>It requires a ResourceBundle named OpenStates. This means a file
named openstates.properties must be found in your class path, such
as your resources directory. This OpenStates client reads two 
keys from the resource bundle, one of which is mandatory.
These are in the form of key=value, one on each line.
The keys are:<br/><br/>

apikey		(Mandatory) The APIKEY from OpenStates.org<br/>
cache		(Optional) Such as c:/tmp/OpenStatesCache<br/>
</p>

<pre>For Example:
apikey=123easyasabcbabyyouandme
cache=c:/tmp/openstates
</pre>
<p>
 If caching is enabled, the queries will be cached and all subsequent calls will 
 return the same information. If you want to disable the cache checking, 
 then call OpenStates.setCache(false) to turn it off and OpenStates.setCache(true)
 to turn it back on.
