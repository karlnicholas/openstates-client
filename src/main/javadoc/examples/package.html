This program is a very simple demonstration of this RESTful Client API.
It requires a ResourceBundle named OpenStates. This means a file
named OpenStates.properties must be found in your class path, such
as your resources directory. This OpenStates client reads two 
keys from the resource bundle, one of which is mandatory.
These are in the form of key=value, one on each line.
The keys are:

apikey    (Mandatory) get from OpenStates.org
cache     (Optional) such as c:/tmp/OpenStatesCache

The basic goal here are to make (most) every possible call 
and use ID's from earlier calls to pass to later calls.

<pre>For Example:
apikey=123easyasabcbabyyouandme
cache=c:/tmp/openstates
</pre>

The example.java program is this:

		// create a class to query
		MetadataClass metadataClass = new MetadataClass(), 
		
		// if you want to turn caching off, uncomment this line
//		OpenStates.setCache(false), 
		
		// Metadata overview ... for all states
		MetadataOverview overview = metadataClass.overview(), 
		
		// print the abbreviation for the first state 
		System.out.println("The abbreviation for " + overview.get(0).name + " is " + overview.get(0).abbreviation),
