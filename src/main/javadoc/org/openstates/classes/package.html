The classes package has the classes that the user is going to typically use to access the API.

Each of the classes should be constructed with no arguments. 

Calls to the classes methods then call the api and return the
results in one of the data package classes.

The queries will be cached, if caching is enabled, and all subsequent calls will return 
the same information. If you want to disable the caching then either 
omit the setting from the openstates.properties file or  
call OpenStates.setCache(false); or OpenStates.setCache(true);
to turn it back on.
